    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <h2>Do I need internet?</h2>
    <p>Not required. Without AI configured, WorkMirror works completely offline using rule-based summaries. With AI enabled (built-in free service or your own API key), external services are only called when generating summaries and suggestions.</p>

    <h2>Why is the page empty/no data?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First, open the "Status" page to check if services are running normally and if there are any recent errors.</li>
        <li>Code monitoring requires configuring monitored folders (add your project folder paths in Settings).</li>
        <li>Browser monitoring depends on local browser history files; check auto-detection results in Settings and specify manually if needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Does it support macOS/Linux/mobile?</h2>
    <p>Currently only Windows 10/11 is supported, with no cloud sync or account system.</p>
